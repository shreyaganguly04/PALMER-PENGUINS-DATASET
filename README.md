<h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>

In this project, I've done EDA and visualisation of the Palmer Penguins dataset using the following libraries :
- Pandas (for data analysis)
- NumPy (for working with arrays)
- Matplotlib And Seaborn (for visualization of data)

I've done the following tasks during my project :

- Downloading the CSV file of my dataset from GitHub. 
- Redirecting the file to the environment where I wanted to work on my project. 
- Importing the necessary libraries.
- Reading the csv file with Pandas and inspecting the first and last five records to gain an understanding of the features of my dataset. 
- Looking for null values in the dataset and analysing how to remove them (changed the null values for categorical data to 'UNKNOWN' and numerical data to their median). Used NumPy to compute the median for each column containing numerical data.
- After cleaning up the data, I used various panda features to analyze the data (investigated the relationship between numerical data and categorical data, discovered the types and varieties of categorical data, further analyzed their frequency, searched for the maximum and minimum values of numerical data, and further filtered the data)
- Visualised the data (with Seaborn) using all the information analysed above.
-  To determine which function to apply along with any other function I used the hit and trial approach and tested the graphs each time after which I decided the best feasible graph to visually display my data.
- Accumulation of conclusions based on the analysis and visualisation.
