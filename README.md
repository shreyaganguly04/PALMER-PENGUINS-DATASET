<h1>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>

In this project, I've done EDA and visualisation of the Palmer Penguins dataset using the following libraries :
- Pandas (for data analysis)
- NumPy (for working with arrays)
- Matplotlib And Seaborn (for visualization of data)

I've done the following tasks during my project:

  -I commenced by downloading the CSV file of my dataset from GitHub. 
  -Then I reallocated it into the same environment I wanted to run my project in .  
  -Then I imported the necessary libraries.After importing the necessary libraries.
  -I read my csv file using Pandas and I looked through the first and last five records so that I can get an understanding about the features of my dataset. 
  -Then I looked for the null values in my dataset and analysed the way to clean them out (changed the null values for categorical data with ‘UNKNOWN’ and for numerical data with their median. For computing the median for each column containing numerical data I used NumPy) 
  -After cleansing my data, I analysed it via various Pandas functionalities. I examined the relationship among numerical and categorical data , discover the sorts and variety of categorical data and additionally analysed their frequencies , looked for the maximum and minimum values for numeric data, and additionally filtered the data to inspect it more .   -Then I visualised my data using all the information I analysed above using Seaborn (to determine which function to apply along with any other function I used the hit and trial approach and tested the graphs each time after which I decided the best feasible graph to visually display my data)
  -Lastly , I accumulated information and conclusions based on my analysis and visualisation.
